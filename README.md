##Jeli2782: Asessment 3 Submission for DECO2017

###RunMate is a single-page tracking web application that enables users to monitor their running performance and habits, as well as reflect on their past runs. I designed and coded this throughout semester 2, covering both front-end and back-end aspects. 

I chose to design my project around Fitness, as running is one of my personal hobbies and something I have always been fascinated in my progress of. My goals for this project was to enable users to have a place to monitor their progress in the intensity, distance and energy burned on their runs. This also would motivate users to continue their journey within health and fitness by viewing their improvements over time. There are also personal elements to the web application, such as personal reflects and post-run pictures the user can upload - all so that the application feels like it is monitering their personal progress.

###Main features: 
- Introduction: 
    - Introduction into RunMate, what it does.
    - Introduction into the different categories it tracks progress in: Intensity of workout, Distance covered per run, Calories Burned.

- Tracking:
    - Fill out forms around Intensity of workout, Distance covered per run, Calories Burned.
    - Personalise tracking and use of RunMate by allowing users to create titles, reflect on their run in a journal-style space and upload pictures/selfies of themselves after their run or the space they ran.
- View Run Logs: 
    - Reflect on and monitor progress by clicking on and viewing past runs and the Intensity of workout, Distance covered per run, Calories Burned, reflections and pictures etc. 
    - Swipe through run history in a carousel swipe-through style
- View Progress:
    - View progress of individual categories: 
        -  Intensity of workout, over time
        -  Distance covered per run, over time
        - Calories Burned, over time


###My initial code was done on Replit, as I found it easier to edit my code and see my changes as I went. 

Using the Date Picker:
- Learned to use a date picker library and how to include corresponding css and javascript files to html for styles and functionality.
- html was modified so that users could not only see today's date, but also have the ability to edit it to create a log entry from a previous date.
- Javascript initialisation code inserted to initialise the date picker library and attach it to the date input field.
